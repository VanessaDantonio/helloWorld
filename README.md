# My first HTML page

## Description

This project is a simple HTML page, which I was able to familiarize myself with heading elements and image attributes. One new property that I've learned was  sizing an image in its width and height using inline attributes. Regarding the Markdown language, I've learned how to add quote blocks, paragraphs, italic and bold text as well as be familiarized with adding links and angle brackets.

> _HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least._ - [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/headings.html "Headings").

> _Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages._  
> _Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure._  
> _&lt;h1&gt; headings should be used for main headings, followed by &lt;h2&gt; headings, then the less important &lt;h3&gt;, and so on._ - [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp "HTML Headings - Headings Are Important").

> _The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page._  
> _Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The &lt;img&gt; tag creates a holding space for the referenced image._  
> _The &lt;img&gt; tag has two required attributes:_  
> * _src - Specifies the path to the image_  
> * _alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed_  
>
> _**Note:** Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads._ - [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp "HTML <img> Tag - Definition and Usage").
